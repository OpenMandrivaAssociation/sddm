Subject: [PATCH] wayland-session: Ensure $SHELL remains correctly set

In some circumstances, the effort of setting the environment
correctly can wind up clobbering the user-specified shell. To
work around this issue, capture the shell setting in a variable
and set it back at the end of environment and profile setup.
